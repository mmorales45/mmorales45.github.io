## About Me
I attened the University of Illinois at Chicago from 2017 to 2021 where I graduated with a Bachelor's of Mechanical Engineering. During my time at UIC, I participated in research primarily in rehabilitation robotics. These experiences inspired me to dive further into robotics.

Currently, I am a Masters in Robotics student at Northwestern University and I am expecting to graduate in the summer of 2022. 

I'm interested in working with autonomous robotics systems and navigation. I had my first interaction with navigation in my ROS class in the Fall 2021 quarter and I am planning to work on a mobile base with a robotic arm attached as my winter project.
